**Brief Discription:**

Companies nowadays create their own applications to display information about them for more exposure.
These applications are intended to be always updated with recent job vacancies, which makes it easier to attract qualified job seekers. In addition, every company owns an internal system to facilitate the working process and eliminate the hassle of paperwork.

This project will act as a portal where all groups of companies, job seekers and
employees, can interact with each other to facilitate the working process.

iWork has two purposes. It serves as a gateway where job seekers can look for appropriate jobs offered by companies and apply for them. Then once they get accepted and start working in a company, it acts as an internal system that connects the hierarchy of the company’s’ employees together.

**Project Main Specifications:**

Companies have profiles on the system that display important information about the company such as:
company name, address, phone number(s), email, vision, type (national, international), domain name,
and field of specialization. Moreover, every company profile displays the available departments along with
jobs that it offers. Every department has a name and a code that uniquely identifies it.
Users of the website can be categorized as follows: job seekers, and staff members. Staff members include HR employees, managers and regular employees, among other types such as public relations, secretaries. Every staff member has one role and works for one department only.
